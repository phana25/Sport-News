            <p>It certainly hasn’t been the split TSM had been hoping for in the LCS, as they’ve now been confirmed to miss out on the playoffs.</p>
            <p class="card-text">
                <br>TSM only had a small chance left to stay in contention for a playoff spot, but missed out due to their loss against 100 Thieves, who looked the stronger team. Things went south very fast for TSM in their match, with individual leads forming for 100 Thieves basically everywhere. Star of the match turned out to be 100 Thieves mid laner Abbedagge, who secured 14 kills and helped his team comfortably past TSM.</br>
                <br>It’s the first time in the history of the franchise that TSM won’t participate in the playoffs. After losing some key players in the previous split, they started working around new players while keeping Huni, Spica and Tactical around, but the experiment didn’t turn out all too well. Off the rift they also faced quite a bit of controversy, such as the recent news surrounding Peter Zhang.</br>
                <br>It’s expected that TSM will look to turn things around for the upcoming split, especially as this weak Spring Split won’t have any real impact on the Summer Split. For now, they have games against CLG and Team Liquid left. TSM isn’t the only team that is sure to miss playoffs, as Immortals was also eliminated from contention.</br>

            <p>After covering toplane and jungle, we have arrived at the most central role in the game, literally, in the form of the midlane.</p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Midlane is famous for its legendary players, plays and champions, and we’re here to cover the latter to help you win games in soloQ.
            </p>

          <img src="./imageES/es5.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." />

            <p class="card-text">
                
                <br>While Ahri has always been relevant, it came to everyone’s surprise that her recent mini-rework shifted her in the direction of borderline overpowered. Even facing nerfs, she remains the undisputed top pick in midlane, and for good reason. Ahri is a jack of all trades. She brings sustain, mobility, waveclear, damage and of course, her charm. She lacks early game, but makes up for it with an amazingly strong mobility ultimate for roaming. Her mobility and ability to quickly pick off targets with her team is unmatched.</br>
                <br>She’s extremely versatile in item building as well, so you can adjust your mythic based on the game. While she can be hard countered by several champions, like Fizz or Yasuo, her overall flexibility lets her be a great pick for soloQ midlane mains. She’s quick and deadly, and looks charming while on the job.</br>

          <h2><b>Kassadin</b></h2>
          <img src="./imageES/es6.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="..." />
          <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">
                
                <br>Kassadin works in the same league as Malphite up top. They’re both incredible counterpicks that any midlaner should consider having in their champion pool. Pick him into champions with weak early games, especially AP mages, and watch them crumble under your level 16 power spike. In the early game, focus on staying alive and grabbing the farm you can. You will undoubtedly be targeted by junglers, so remember to bring wards and a patient mindset. Look for simple roams where possible, but highly prioritize experience and cs over everything else.</br>
                <br>With Kassadin in the game, the game is never truly over. SoloQ tends to bring chaotic games where anything can happen, and that’s where Kassadin can thrive and get in control. Keep your mental and those of your teammates’ cool, and please, for everyone’s sake, don’t blind pick him. AD assassins and bruisers are everywhere, you won’t enjoy laning against those.</br>

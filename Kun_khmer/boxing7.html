                        <br>PNN TV and ISI STEEL have agreed to continue their partnership to develop and promote Kun Khmer.</br>
                        <br>On Sunday, the two parties launched together the third season of the ISI Palm-ISI Pipe Kun Khmer Championship.  The launching follows two years’ of successful collaboration to develop players and make the sport more well-known inside and outside the Kingdom.</br>
                        <br>Also known as Pradal Serey, Kun Khmer is an ancient Cambodian martial art where fighters use punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes to subdue their opponents. Players win a match via knockout, technical knockout or by points. Kun Khmer, which is similar to kickboxing, is now making a revival after nearly disappearing during the Khmer Rouge era.</br>
                        <br>PNN TV is among the leading television companies in Cambodia, while ISI STEEL is a major producer of construction materials.</br>
                        <br>In a joint statement, the two sides said they always try to think of something new and beneficial to the development of the sport, with an eye towards making it popular and helping Cambodia in major tournaments, including the 2023 Southeast Asian Games.</br>
                        <br>Cambodian sports authorities have earlier expressed a strong desire to win medals in Kun Khmer and related sports during the 2023 SEA Games, which Cambodia will be hosting for the first time. PNN TV and ISI STEEL stressed that ISI Palm-ISI Pipe Kun Khmer Championship will contribute to that effort.</br>
                        <br>In a previous interview, Samnob, the sports chief at PNN TV, said that such programmes will help Cambodia produce outstanding boxers and martial artists in time for international competitions, including the 2023 SEA Games. “Our focus is on the new generation of boxers,” he pointed out.</br>
                        <br>There are eight players selected from eight Kun Khmer clubs that will participate in the tournament. According to the organisers, they are Rin David, Pich Bunseth, Sern Thaysan, Khem Chan, Phuon Lang Kosin, Morn Phearum, Thun Englai and Yi Dub.</br>
                        <br>The players will compete in the 54-kilogram category, with total prize money pegged at $7,317.</br>
                        <br>The players will be divided into two groups. The top two players from each group will advance to the semi-finals, with the winners facing each other in the finals.</br>
                        <br>The first group of matches was held on October 4, and will continue every Sunday (starting 12pm) until  January 2021, The matches will be shown live on PNN TV and the Facebook pages of PNN Sport and ISI STEEL.</br>
